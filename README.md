# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of our analysis was to look at aggregated fundraising data across a multitude of countries and entertainment categories. We utilize various features of excel (such as filtering, pivot tables and charts), in order to present the data in a way that makes pertinant trends easier to identify. 

### Purpose

Our purpose is to help a client, Louise, with a fundraising campaign for her play, Fever. In order to help Louise, we will use excel to better understand a large set of data with information regarding various entertainment kickstarter funding campaigns. We will perform various analyses and visualizations of the data so Louis can determine an informed strategy for her fundraising campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

How many data points there are. What type of data are there.Converting data into different formats. Applying visual ques to important data categories. Picture of RGY columns in "success/fail"(value shading). Help Louise set up incentives by looking at average donation amount. Looking at rounded/average data (percentage funded) and using error control to keep the results sane. Reformatting the data to have more cols sometimes (eg parent and subcat from original column). Using pivot tables to summarize data, and produce plots from that. Using search and filters to simplify data sets. Using vlookup to hone in on a specific subset. Looking at success versus type of input. Analyzed some measures of central tendancies.

Challenges during this analysis involved understanding how the interplay between various filters worked. At first, I was not sure how "stacking," multiple filters worked. I thought that by selecting a filter, it automatically removed any other filters but now I know this is not the case. The biggest concepual challenge was understanding how to create the pivot tables, specifically, choosing the best options for the row, column and value sections of the table in order to present the data in a way that is natural and sensical. The way that this challenge was overcome was simply by brute force - I had to mess around with several pivot tables in order to develop an intuition about how to summarize large sets of data in a way that becomes easy to understand and present 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

One particulary important analysis which was performed, involves looking at the outcomes of various theater kickstarters by the time of year in which the campaign was launched. To do this, a pivot table was constructed using a filter over the parent category (so that the theater category could be considered on its own). The pivot table summarized data based on the total number of plays launched during a particular month (summing over all years) and looked at the three outcomes (successful, failed or canceled). Below are images showing the pivot table as well as the chart produced from the pivot table. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
